    <p>Decided to play around with a better 'placeholder logo' kind of image for this site because the previous one is horrendous. It's always good to be able to look back and critique your own past work.</p>

<p>How did the previous logo came about anyway? I drew it on paper and used Illustrator to cut it out. I'm no expert at it, but I wanted to experiment and find out how designers copied and digitalised their handmade work.</p>

<p>Moving on to creating a new 'placeholder logo' - for an hour, I decided to play around with 2 very simple shapes, that can represent two alphabets, 'h' and 'y':</p>

<p><img src="/assets/logos0.png" alt="My helpful screenshot" /><br></p>

<p>Firstly, I played around with the 'straight' shape. Didn't like it because I had the impression that straight defined rigidity and stiffness...</p>

<p><img src="/assets/logos1.png" alt="My helpful screenshot" /><br></p>

<p>Moved on to the 'rounder' shape. I think I preferred this better. And this exercise gave me more thoughts of 'This might work' as compared to the first round.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/logos2.png" alt="My helpful screenshot" /><br></p>

<p>I also thought one of them looked like a Pikachu if I added some color ... here ...</p>

<p><img src="/assets/pikachu.png" alt="My helpful screenshot" /><br></p>

<p>And just for fun, mixed the two up and made some shapes. Well ...</p>

<p><img src="/assets/logos3.png" alt="My helpful screenshot" /><br></p>

<p>Decided on the current one after reviewing what I had. Again, I'm no expert at visual design, so I just went with what I liked most!</p>
