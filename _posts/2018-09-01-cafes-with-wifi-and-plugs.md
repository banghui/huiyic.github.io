I hang out at cafes on weekends quite a bit, and am always on a hunt for cafes with wifi and plugs. Thought to share my list of cafes that I usually frequent!

<b>Baker and Cook (Chip Bee Gardens)</b>
My top pick. Good vibes, usually busy during the brunch timing, but other than that, it's quite a chill place to work at. They have a huge assortment of cakes, pastries and tarts which are plenty delicious! I usually just go for the tartines.

They have branches all over Singapore but I haven't visited any of the rest.

<b>Joe and Dough (Milennial Walk)</b>
I went on a Sunday evening, and it was very conducive as there were very little people.


<b>COSTA Coffee (Holland V)</b>
Decent place to work if you go early enough, like before 1pm on the weekends. Then it'll slowly get crowded with students.
Couple plugs available on the 2nd floor, haven't seen any on the 1st floor. 


<b>Jewel Coffee (Claymore Connect)</b>
It's a bit at the far end of Orchard Road, but you'll get rewarded with a quiet and conducive environment! Plenty of space inside and outside, with some plugs available.
A good place to chill if you're looking for somewhere near town, so that you can take a walk along Orchard Road / meet your friends when you're done with your work. Can also go to the Singapore's biggest Kinokuniya at Ngee Ann City to browse when you're done! 

<b>The Book Cafe (River Valley)</b>
My preference are places that I can pay first beforehand, but this is the only place on the list that's not the case. Also, out of all on this list, this place is one of the more inaccessible ones, as there isn't really an MRT nearby. 
There is a good mix of comfy sofas and proper desk and tables. I only found plugs near the comfy areas. Food and coffee were pretty average though, nothing to shout about.

<b>Lowercase (Rochor)</b>
Once you get out of Rochor MRT, it's just a 2 minute walk away from the MRT, right where LASALLE is at. When I was there on a Saturday afternoon, it was so empty that I had plenty of seats to choose from. 
You'll smell like food after that though, their ventilation isn't really good.


<b>Mellower Coffee (Bugis)</b>
One of my favourites - plenty of space and plugs. Coffee is also pretty decent, albeit a little pricey. Tends to get a little cold, so do bring a jacket. After you're done with chilling, you can just walk around Bugis too.

Starbucks and Coffee Beans are decent fall-backs (though they might not have plugs), just that my preference is to explore as much as possible.
