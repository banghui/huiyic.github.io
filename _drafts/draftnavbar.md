While looking around for inspiration for the site's nav bar, I came across some pretty interesting nav bar examples that I'd thought to share... they're by no means the best, and I'm not an expert in this particular area.

1. Spook Studio

This was the primary inspiration for this site's nav bar. I'm still playing around with it and it's far from perfect...

3. The San Francisco Globe
Love how 'The San Francisco Globe' condenses to simply just its initials. 

4. Invision App
Locking the nav bar at the top while scrolling is a very common thing to do, but Invision 



5. Twitter
While this isn't exactly a nav bar, I thought it was interesting to see the changes from the Profile picture to a condensed logo version. And surprisingly it only appears on Safari, and not on Chrome and Fox.



And here's a site with more navigation inspiration.

I'm personally still a fan of keeping it on the top though, where it's the most visible.

Another thought regarding 'top banners' is perhaps to avoid putting it in black, or designing it to look like an ad. There was once I was trying out a particulat website and was looking for a 'BACK' button. I got quite frustrated when I couldn't find it, and I finally found it on the top black banner, which I conveniently ignored because it looked like an advertisement. Banner blindness?

I think one of the main problems with such nav bars is its loading time? While it looks pretty when scrolling, if it slows the loading of the page considerably, then I wouldn't think it's good to implement, since it deters the user from a smooth experience. Any ideas on how to implement such a nav bar, yet maintain the smooth loading of the page?
